I liked how \r\n                versatile it was and how easy it was to set up a server using the \r\n                <strong>Express</strong> framework. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                From there I started building <strong>RESTful APIs</strong> and tested my Routes\r\n                using Postman. I found Postman really useful because you could make requests and set \r\n                up scripts which made testing authorized routes a lot easier. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                I eventually set up authorization routes for creating users, encrypting their password using\r\n                the bcrypt library, and storing users in a mondodb database using Mongoose ODM. users were \r\n                assigned JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authorize access to protected routes. In a different project\r\n                I used the passport.js library to leverage a google strategy allowing users to login to the application\r\n                using google authentication. I added an extra layer of authentication to only allow users on a \r\n                whitelist to have login priveleges.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p> \r\n                I really like using node and I found installing extra libraries using NPM a great tool for \r\n                scaffolding parts which were tricky to do.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                For my next steps I am hoping to use Redis-cache and further improve my knowledge of \r\n                route testing using JEST.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n        </>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst details = {\r\n    page: 'Node.js'\r\n  }\r\n\r\nexport default mainLayout(details)(Node)\r\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AAIA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
