Since Then I have developed my knowledge in Python and added\r\n                more skills \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                I used Python on the raspberry Pi in order to interact with the GPIO pins. In my first \r\n                programming competition; the SAIT 2017 Cisco Hackathon, I was responsible for emulating\r\n                an electronic alarm using a python script. Our team finished first in this hackathon\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p><b>Picture iot device</b></p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                In the 2017 U of C hackathon our team created a Biomedical IoT device. my Role in the project\r\n                included writing a multi-threaded program to receive heart rate information using a heart rate\r\n                sensor and allow that information to be consumed via a RESTful endpoint using Flask. We ended\r\n                up coming third in this competition and at the time we had about 4 months of formal programming\r\n                education. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                For my application to Mawer Investment Management I was given a programming challenge as part of\r\n                my interview process. The challenge was to get all the Insider information from the SEDI website. \r\n                To do this I wrote a Python Application using the HTML parsing library: \r\n                'Beautiful soup', from there I was able to retrieve all of the insiders and save their \r\n                information in a MySQL database\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                I became interested in data science and machine learning over the past year and I ended up taking\r\n                a number of courses to learn about machine learning in python. During this time I completed several\r\n                course-based projects using Jupyter Notebook, SciKit Learn, Pandas, Numpy and Seaborn.
