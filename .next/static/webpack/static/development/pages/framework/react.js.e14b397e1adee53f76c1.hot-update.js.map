I heard about the benefits of React through some friends and \r\n                decided to explore the framework. After taking a variety of courses, I can attest to the \r\n                scalability and flexibility of React and currently use it as my go-to framework for building \r\n                interactive UIs.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                For larger projects I've used Redux for state-management; however, I've found the \r\n                context API to be a very useful too and have used it on a couple of small projects.\r\n                For next steps in state management, I plan on using Apollo Client with GraphQL.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Fortunately React is very familiar to React Native. Though I've \r\n                only created a couple of small react-native test projects, I'm hoping to create a production\r\n                version application in the future.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                My additional experience with React includes working with websockets with Socket.io, higher\r\n                order components, and Next.js for Server Side Rendered applications (SSR) to increase Search \r\n                engine optimization (SEO)\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                the following is a list of resources I have used to learn React:\r\n            </p>\r\n            <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/\">Modern React with Redux</a>\r\n            <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux-tutorial/\">Advanced React and Redux</a>\r\n            <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux-tutorial/\">Node with React: Fullstack Web Development</a>\r\n\r\n            \r\n        </PageLayout>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst details = {\r\n    page: 'react & Redux'\r\n  }\r\n\r\nexport default reactRedux\r\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAJA;AACA;AAMA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AAIA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
