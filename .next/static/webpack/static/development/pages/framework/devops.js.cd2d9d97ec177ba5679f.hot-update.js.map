JIRA software was used to track issues throughout the development process\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                I use git and github which aligns with the majority of developers who use source control and\r\n                online repository solutions. Professionally, I have used Azure DevOps to build, test, conduct pull \r\n                request, and deploy code with Continuous Intergration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p><b>docker pic?</b></p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                In early 2020, I began exploring Docker and DockerHub. I created containers for front-end UI servers and\r\n                backend Node.js Servers and used an NGINX to route requests to the backend and front end servers. Next I used\r\n                Travis CI to set up a continuous integration pipeline. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Although, I am not an expert in DevOps, I aspire to learn more and have made improving DevOps \r\n                practices my primary goal for 2020. \r\n            </p>\r\n        </PageLayout>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst details = {\r\n    page: 'Docker'\r\n  }\r\n\r\nexport default DevOps\r\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAJA;AACA;AAMA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AAIA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
