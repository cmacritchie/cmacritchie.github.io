In my first \r\n                programming competition; the SAIT 2017 Cisco Hackathon, I was responsible for emulating\r\n                an electronic alarm using a python script.

We ended\r\n                up coming third in this competition and at the time we had about 4 months of formal programming\r\n                education. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                For my application at Mawer Investment management I was given a programming challenge as part of\r\n                my interview process. The challenge was to get all the Insider information from the SEDI website\r\n                on all the insiders. To do this I wrote a pythong Application using the HTML parsing library: 'beautiful soup'\r\n                from there I was able to retrieve all of the insiders and save their information in a MYSQL database\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                I became interested in data science and machine learning over the past year and I ended up taking\r\n                a number of courses to learn about machine learning in python. During this time I completed a number\r\n                of course-based projects that included Jupyter Notebook, SciKit LEarn, Pandas, Numpy and Seabor. Though\r\n                I have only just staretd my career as a data scientist I hope to explore the data science world\r\n                further and develop skills using TensorFlow, Pytorch and Hadoop\r\n            </p>\r\n        </>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst details = {\r\n    page: 'Python'\r\n  }\r\n\r\nexport default mainLayout(details)(Node)\r\n","module.exports = dll_ef0ff7c60362f24a921f;"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AARA;AAcA;AAfA;AACA;AAgBA;;;;;;;;;;;AClBA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;;;;;;;;;;;ACZA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;ACAA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AADA;AAIA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AC7CA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
