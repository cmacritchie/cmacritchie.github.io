                Python was the first language that I learned when I made the decision to pivot my career
                from Water Resourcs Engineering in 2016.

                I used Python on the Raspberry Pi in order to interact with the GPIO pins. In my first 
                programming competition-the SAIT 2017 Cisco Hackathon, I was responsible for emulating
                an electronic alarm using a python script. Our team finished first in this hackathon.

                In the 2017 U of C hackathon our team created a Biomedical IoT device. my Role in the project
                included writing a multi-threaded program to receive heart rate information using a heart rate
                sensor and allow that information to be consumed via a RESTful endpoint using Flask. We ended
                up finishing third in this competition and at the time we had about 4 months of formal programming
                education.

                For my application to Mawer Investment Management I was given a programming challenge as part of
                my interview process. The challenge was to get all the Insider information from the SEDI website. 
                To do this I wrote a Python Application using the HTML parsing library: 
                'Beautiful soup', from there I was able to retrieve all of the insiders and save their 
                information in a MySQL database

                I became interested in data science and machine learning over the past year and I ended up taking
                a number of courses to learn about machine learning in Python. During this time I completed several
                course-based projects using Jupyter Notebook, SciKit Learn, Pandas, Numpy and Seaborn.

                I have just started my career as a data scientist. I hope to explore data science
                further and develop skills using TensorFlow, Pytorch and Hadoop.
